<h2>Quick Start:</h2>

- In Your project install Black.Hole.ORM from Nuget.org

- In your Program.cs add (Namespace => using BlackHole.Configuration)
  Add the following line into your IServiceCollection =>
    services.SuperNova(settings => settings.AddDatabase(connection => connection.UseSqlServer(connectionString)))

- Create some Entities in any folder that Inherit from the class 'BlackHoleEntity<int>' for Entities that are using Integer as Id,
  or 'BlackHoleEntity<Guid>' for Entities that are using Guid as Id
  or 'BlackHoleEntity<string>' for Entities that are using SHA1 hash as Id. (Namespace => using BlackHole.Entities)
  
- There is also the 'BHOpenEntity<Entity type>' Interface which is a more flexible and advanced Entity, with more capabilities, but slightly less performance.
  It is suggested to advanced Developers that want to have full control of the Entity, using Composite Keys , Autogenerated values and more..

- Add properties on your Entities except the Id property that already exists in the BlackHoleEntity class.

- Add Attributes to the properties of your Entities' 
  '[ForeignKey(typeof(Entity), nullability)]' , '[NotNullable]', [DefaultValue(object)] and '[VarCharSize(int)]'
  * You can also use '[UseActivator]' attribute on your Entity, to take advantage of the 'IsActive' column in case you need to keep the
  data after delete. (Namespace => using BlackHole.Entities)

- Make your services Inherit from 'BlackHoleScoped' or 'BlackHoleSingleton' or 'BlackHoleTransient' so they will be automatically
  registered on the Startup to the IServiceCollection. (Namespace => using BlackHole.Services)
  
 - Last step , go to your services or your controllers and add the Interfaces for the DataProviders =>
  private readonly IBHDataProvider<Entity,IdType> _entityService;
  private readonly IBHOpenDataProvider<BHOpenEntity> _openEntityService;
  Example: IBHDataProvider<Customer,Guid> _customerService; (Namespace => using BlackHole.Core)
  
 - Done! You are ready to use all the functionality of the Data Providers in your services.
 - Data Providers contain all the required methods to cimmunicate with the database.
